# Exercise 3.2 - Hierarchies: Your Way!

Join the [Hierarchies: Your Way!](https://classroom.github.com/a/qQCXOYNs) Github Classroom assignment.

Your task is to design (and draw) a hierarchy of classes in a domain of your choice, then implement your hierarchy.

Requirements:

* You must include at least four classes
* At least two subclasses must include an overridden methods
* At least one class must include a useful private method

> Note: Your classes' abilities can be on the simple side; for this exercise, the hierarchy is the more important part.

1. Draw the class hierarchy diagram for your classes. Take a screenshot or photo of the diagram with your phone and then upload it to the repo with the name class_diagram.jpg, and make a commit.

> Tip: First, think about what attributes and behaviours each of the classes should have, keeping in mind which will be inherited from parent classes. If you need to customize the behaviour in a particular superclass's method, you can override the method in your own class. 

2. Starting at the top of your drawing, write out the definition for your first class. Be sure to include some code that uses all the methods in the class to check that it is properly implemented, run it, and then make a commit.

3. Next, write the definition for your next class.  Be sure to include some code that uses all the methods in the class to check that it is properly implemented, run it, and then make a commit.

4. Continue implementing your classes top-to-bottom, committing after each one until you are done.
